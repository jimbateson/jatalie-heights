# Jatalie Heights

A simple personal walking blog for two keen, weekly(ish) walkers.

## Build

Site is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and is currently WIP.

This is the first time I have used SSG and there are plenty of things I am still learning. The plan is for me to introduce new features, refactor code and generally improve the site as my knowledge increases. Here is a full list of the things I am aware of / features I would like to implement.

if you notice any bugs, please open an issue and I will take a look.

* Add responsive image solution (picture element)
* Improve performance of site
* Improve accessibility of site
* Add some SEO to the site
* Better way of doing breadcrumbs
* ~~Better way of sharing includes for the walks~~
* ~~Better way or sharing includes for the walk list items~~
* Responsive tidy up
* ~~Improve npm tasks for the static build, making it easier to add these new features!~~
* Add all walks from the Todo list we have in a Google Doc - Need to find a way to automatically do this, possibly using JSON? Taking far too long manually!
* Once all walk Todo items added, have a better way to sort them, and then possibly filter them by location etc
* Get better at writing blog posts!
* Add an equipment page (need to think of sufficient content)
* Format walk dates correctly (30th December 2018 for example)
* Add service worker
