<h1>Jatalie Heights</h1>
<p>A simple personal walking blog for two keen, weekly(ish) walkers.</p>
<h2>Build</h2>
<p>Site is built using <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">11ty</a> and deployed using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and is currently WIP.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have used SSG and there are plenty of things I am still learning. The plan is for me to introduce new features, refactor code and generally improve the site as my knowledge increases. Here is a full list of the things I am aware of / features I would like to implement.</p>
<p>if you notices any bugs, please open an issue and I will take a look.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add responsive image solution (picture element)</li>
<li>Improve perfermance of site</li>
<li>Improve accessibility of site</li>
<li>Add some SEO to the site</li>
<li>Better way of doing breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Better way of sharing includes for the walks</li>
<li>Better way or sharing includes for the walk list items</li>
<li>Responsive tidy up</li>
<li>Improve npm tasks for the static build, making it easier to add these new features!</li>
<li>Add all walks from the Todo list we have in a Google Doc</li>
<li>Once all walk Todo items added, have a better way to sort them, and then possibly filter them by location etc</li>
<li>Get better at writing blog posts!</li>
<li>Add an equipment page (need to think of sufficient content)</li>
</ul>
