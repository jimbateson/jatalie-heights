<h1>Jatalie Heights</h1>
<p>A simple personal walking blog for a keen, weekly(ish) walker.</p>
<h2>Build</h2>
<p>Site is built using <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">11ty</a> and deployed using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and is currently WIP.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have used a SSG and there are plenty of things I am still learning. The plan is for me to introduce new features, refactor code and generally improve the site as my knowledge increases. Here is a full list of the things I am aware of / features I would like to implement.</p>
<p>if you notice any bugs, please open an issue and I will take a look.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Add responsive image solution (picture element)</s></li>
<li>Generate correct responsive image crops</li>
<li>Investigate image quality issues</li>
<li>Improve performance of site</li>
<li>Improve accessibility of site</li>
<li>Add some SEO to the site</li>
<li>Better way of doing breadcrumbs</li>
<li><s>Better way of sharing includes for the walks</s></li>
<li><s>Better way or sharing includes for the walk list items</s></li>
<li>Responsive tidy up</li>
<li><s>Improve npm tasks for the static build, making it easier to add these new features!</s></li>
<li>Add all walks from the Todo list we have in a Google Doc - Need to find a way to automatically do this, possibly using JSON? Taking far too long manually!</li>
<li>Once all walk Todo items added, have a better way to sort them, and then possibly filter them by location etc</li>
<li>Get better at writing blog posts!</li>
<li>Add an equipment page (need to think of sufficient content)</li>
<li>Format walk dates correctly (30th December 2018 for example)</li>
<li>Add service worker</li>
</ul>
